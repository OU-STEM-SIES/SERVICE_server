The functions in management/commands can be called directly through manage.py, for example:

>> python3 manage.py generate_test_db
>> python3 manage.py generate_random_moods

Mock usernames and passwords are generated from mock_users.csv, which has 1000 random users 

The following fuctions will print information to the console:

>> python3 manage.py print_all_moods
>> python3 manage.py print_all_pacs
>> python3 manage.py print_all_users
>> python3 manage.py print_all_lineworkers
